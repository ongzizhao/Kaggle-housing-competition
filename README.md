# Kaggle housing competition
 ames housing dataset
 
 I want to practice ML algorithms,data preprocessing and python skills that i self learnt through online resources. i will be applying different ML strategies such as LinearRegression , DecisionTree , RandomForest, XGBRegressor. i also practice using the sklearn API and get familiar with usage of pipeline and columntransformer during data preprocessing and model implementation. the model's hyperparameters will be further fine tuned using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
 
 
 
 
 first attempt using XGBRegressor: 
 rmse = 23162, kaggle score = 0.13558
